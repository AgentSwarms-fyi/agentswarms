# Changelog

Notable changes to AgentSwarms. Newest first.

This file exists partly for you and partly for the person evaluating whether
this project is maintained — an absent changelog reads as abandonment risk
regardless of how active the commit log is.

Dates are the date work landed, not a release date. The project does not yet
cut numbered releases; see [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md).

## Unreleased

### Data sources

- **Connections can be shared through IAM** — databases/warehouses and app
  sources are now grantable resource types, so an analyst uses a connection
  without a second copy of the credential existing. A shared connection **runs
  as its owner**: the credential is decrypted server-side and the query goes to
  the owner's warehouse, so a grantee gains the _use_ of it without ever
  receiving it. Unlike other shared resources these rows carry the encrypted
  secret, so there is deliberately **no row-level policy** granting access —
  the grant is resolved server-side and the row loaded with the service role.
  A shared app source **syncs as its owner, into the owner's datasets**, so a
  grantee re-running a stale sync refreshes the real data rather than building
  a parallel copy under their own account.
- **Connection pooling** for PostgreSQL- and MySQL-family sources. Opening a
  connection was **92% of a `SELECT 1`** against a local Postgres (24.9 ms of
  27.1 ms), and that is the best case — a loopback socket with no TLS. End to
  end the driver went from **30.7 ms to 2.9 ms per query**, with identical
  results; `scripts/bench-pool.ts` reproduces both numbers and asserts the
  equality. Pools are keyed by a hash of every credential, so two tenants never
  share a session and a rotated password never reuses the old one.
- **Corporate proxy support and retries** on every outbound connector call.
  `HTTPS_PROXY`/`NO_PROXY` are honoured — many enterprises have no direct
  egress at all, and without this the product simply cannot reach Snowflake or
  Stripe from inside such a network. Transient failures retry with exponential
  backoff and full jitter. `500` is deliberately **not** retried by default: it
  usually means the query ran and then failed, so a retry pays for the same
  scan twice.
- **Scheduled health checks and credential age** for data connections, using
  the product's own probes rather than bespoke ones. A warehouse password
  expiring on your rotation policy now surfaces as a badge and one
  notification, instead of a dashboard erroring in front of a customer.
  Advisory throughout — nothing is auto-disabled and nothing expires.
- **SaaS connectors.** Google Sheets, Stripe, Shopify, HubSpot and Salesforce
  sync into datasets on a shared ingest path — the same type inference,
  staging and snapshot-then-swap a CSV upload uses, so a synced dataset
  behaves identically to an uploaded one. Sync runs manually or on an hourly,
  daily or weekly schedule.
- **12 more databases and warehouses**, taking the total to 22: Microsoft SQL
  Server / Azure SQL, ClickHouse, CockroachDB, TimescaleDB, AlloyDB,
  Greenplum, YugabyteDB, MariaDB, SingleStore, StarRocks, Apache Doris and
  PlanetScale. Wire-compatible providers share one proven driver per protocol
  rather than getting near-duplicate implementations.
- **Fixed: 17 of 22 warehouse providers could not be saved.** The `provider`
  CHECK constraint had never been widened past the original five, so
  PostgreSQL, MySQL, Trino, Athena and Oracle — all long shipped — failed on
  insert with a constraint violation that named neither the provider nor the
  reason. A test now parses the constraint from the migrations and fails CI if
  it drifts from the TypeScript union again.

### Semantic layer

- **Relative date filters**: `last_n_days`, `this_month`, `last_month`,
  `this_quarter`, `last_quarter`, `ytd`. Half-open UTC windows resolved at
  query time, so a dashboard does not need editing as time passes.
- **Period-over-period**: `yoy`, `mom`, `prior_period`, adding `_prev`,
  `_change` and `_pct_change` per metric. Implemented as a date-shifted
  self-join rather than `LAG`, so a gap in the series cannot line a period up
  against the wrong predecessor.

### Query engine

- **DuckDB is now the default local engine**; `LOCAL_ENGINE=alasql` is the
  escape hatch. Rows load through DuckDB's appender rather than one
  parameterised INSERT per row: a 5,000-row aggregate went from 2,152 ms to
  19.6 ms.

### Security & governance

- **Per-agent semantic model allow-list**, deny by default. Enabling the
  Semantic Metrics tool alone no longer grants an agent every model in the
  account; it is also enforced when the tool runs, not only in what the agent
  is shown.
- **Swarm scheduler correctness**: the "claim" before a scheduled run was an
  unconditional update and claimed nothing, so two app instances could each
  fire the same scheduled swarm. Also, an interval of zero meant the swarm ran
  every tick, for ever.
- First test coverage for the AES-GCM credential encryption paths and for the
  scheduler.

### Site

- Public [Security](/security) and [Licensing & support](/license) pages.
- Dashboard surfaces failed syncs, unreachable connections, failed scheduled
  runs, and budget used this month.

### Documentation

- **Fixed: the docs asked for a Supabase project id that nothing reads.**
  `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` and `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` were in
  `.env.example`'s _required_ block, the Dockerfile, compose build args and
  three docs. The CLI takes the ref as `supabase link --project-ref`, a flag.
  A required setup step that did nothing.
- **Fixed: the notebook runtime's env/settings precedence was documented
  backwards**, and it promised a `NOTEBOOK_EGRESS_ALLOWLIST` variable that does
  not exist.
- **Fixed: "all ten connectors"** — written when there were ten, and there are 22. Worse, only ten were _documented_: SQL Server and ClickHouse, which have
  fields nothing else has, had no entry at all.
- Twelve environment variables the code reads were documented nowhere,
  including four rate limits with no other way to discover them.
- `tests/unit/docsFreshness.test.ts` now fails CI on any of these: an env var
  the code reads that no doc mentions, a setting the docs promise that no code
  reads, or a stale connector count.
